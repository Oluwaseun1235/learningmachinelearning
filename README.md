1. Intro to ML: ML Zero to Hero (Part 1) - https://bit.ly/lml-001
2. Basic Computer Vision: ML Zero to Hero (Part 2) - https://bit.ly/lml-002 (If you watched Part 1 & didn't go on to watch Part 2, this learning machine learning thing may be a bit hectic for you. For every resource I link to, please follow that resource down the rabbit hole i.e. links to related articles, playlists that a video belongs to, suggestions & recommendations etc.)
3. Search on Google (or your preferred search engine) for "machine learning" - https://www.google.com/search?q=machine+learning&oq=machine+learning (I always do this when learning something knew or whenever I run in to a bug, error message etc. Read at least the top non-ad post.)
4. Read (or study) the Wikipedia entry for machine learning - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning (Don't forget to go down the rabbit hole as much as you can).
5. Introducing convolutional neural networks: ML Zero to Hero (Part 3) - https://bit.ly/lml-003 (Down the rabbit hole, at least watch Part 4 - https://bit.ly/lml-004x - of this series) 
6. Learn Python, the most important language for data science & machine learning - https://bit.ly/lml-005 (I prefer Kaggle's introductory courses but the official **Python Tutorial, Datacamp, Pluralsight, Udacity, Udemy** and a host of others are all excellent resources). So "Why **Kaggle**? And what is Kaggle?" Your preferred search engine and Wikipedia to the rescue!
7. TF 2.x on Kaggle (TF Dev Summit '20) - https://bit.ly/lml-006. For some inspiration (& perspiration) from [TF Dev Summit 2020](https://www.tensorflow.org/dev-summit), go further down the rabbit hole and at least watch the keynote on this playlist - https://bit.ly/lml-007
8. Watch https://bit.ly/lml-008 or https://bit.ly/lml-009 - if you haven't listened to **Jeff Dean** ('Yes, ***"The Jeff Dean"***') speak about The Grand Challenges - https://bit.ly/grn-chl. You can also read this article - https://bit.ly/jd-grn-chl-dn - where he shares his thoughts on *"How AI Can Solve The Grand Challenges"*.
9. My next best "What is Machine Learning" video would be from **Yufeng Guo** - https://bit.ly/lml-010. You can watch the entire *"AI Adventures"* series via - https://bit.ly/lml-010p
10. At this point you should have a firm grasp of **"Machine Learning 101"**. I strongly suggest you bookmark/save/download/print these articles for past, present & future reference - https://bit.ly/lml-011a or https://bit.ly/lml-011b
11. **Robert John's** "Bite-Sized Machine Learning Series" - Part 1 (https://bit.ly/lml-rbj01), Part 2 (https://bit.ly/lml-rbj02), Part 3 (https://bit.ly/lml-rbj03) are definitely good reads.
12. In some of the previous resources shared, you may have come across or interacted with **Colab**. "What is Colab?" This playlist - https://bit.ly/lml-012p - should get you started with understanding and using Colab.
